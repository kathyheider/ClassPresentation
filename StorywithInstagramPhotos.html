        <h2>Tell The Story--Any Story will work</h2>
        <p>It is Saturday night and you separately asked multiple friends if they would like to have dinner or get together.  
        They responded and said "I'd love to, but I am going to stay home and relax or  " I don't have any formal plans. I am probably going to stay home and read a book. </p>
        <p>Not having any plans myself, I stay home as well watching another episode of Orange is the New Black as my entertainment.  </p>
        <p>Since I didn't go out on Saturday night, I'm up early on Sunday morning with the cats, drinking coffee and scrolling Instagram and Facebook.  </p>
        <p> Oh, I see on Facebook looks like there was a dinner party at a local restaurant.  It was early in the evening looks just like dinner across town.

        <p>As you continue to scroll through as the night goes on, the friends start to post their pictures on 
        Instagram showing their group picture from the BeerBarge PDX and then even later in the night they 
        have clearly been drinking and posted additional Instagram photos of dancing at the local kareoke bar</p>
